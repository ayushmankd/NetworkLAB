A student-hospital pair that satisfies (i)–(iii) is called a blocking pair. Thus a matching is
stable if and only if there is no blocking pair. A blocking pair spells trouble, because the pair
may be tempted to secede from the process and match with each other directly. (E.g., if you
get assigned to your third-favorite hospital, it’s not that hard to call your top two choices
to double-check that they don’t prefer you to any of the students they admitted. And if one
of them does, both sides are motivated to work something out. . . )
For example, in Figure 1, consider any matching where A is not assigned to D. By
assumption, (i) holds. Since A ranks D first and vice versa, S must be assigned to a
hospitals she likes less than D (so (ii) holds) and H is assigned a student it likes less than
A (so (iii) holds). Thus (A, D) form a blocking pair whenever A is not assigned to D, and
every stable matching must match A and D.
Stability seems like a nice property — but can it always be achieved? A priori, it is not
obvious that a stable matching is guaranteed to exist (for any preferences of the participants).
In the example in Figure 1, we have already argued that any stable matching must assign
